# SkunkNet Secure Stablecoin Streaming Network (sTT)
- Self Organized and Self Stablized Stablecoin Secure & Scalable Streaming Protocol on Matic Network

## Introduction

SkunkNet Secure Stablecoin is Algorithmic Stablecoin providing users the advantages of Blockchain through privacy in transactions while at the time same protecting users from high volatility. SemiotNet works with a set of two supply side dynamics â€“ expansion and contraction. If the price of the coin rises, automatically more coins are issue to increase the supply and reduce the price. The same goes for price reduction wherein supply is contracted digitally to increase the price back to equilibrium. The user always holds the same percentage of Stablecoins from the universe throughout such expansion and contraction phases, hence protecting the user from a significant amount of market risk. 

SkunkNet has a twofold perspective towards the deployment of an Algorithmic Stablecoin. Stemming from the guarantee of privacy, it provides more amateur users to experiment with the world of cryptocurrencies before moving into more volatile currencies. Secondly it ensures the primary usage of a Stablecoin as a means to an end in the financial system by serving as a tender towards making payments through an official system. Stablecoins have grown over 493% over 2020 and the road ahead is only steeper. SemiotNet is a strong and balanced entry into this world of Stablecoins guaranteeing the fiat value of currency along with the privacy which is held most dearest in this digital age.
